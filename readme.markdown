# museic

Just a plain simple MP3 player with a few hacks to help me practice with the
Guitar.

Features like,

- Allow a delay before playing a track. This is to give you time to prepare if
you want to play along with the track.
- Ummm...that's all for now...

# Compiling

This is a Maven project and _strictly_ needs an **Oracle** JDK and JRE since it
uses JavaFX. Actually, you _might_ be able to work with OpenJDK but I don't know
how to make JavaFX work with it.

Java 6 should be fine but I've only tested this in Java 7. Java 8 has better
theoretical compatibility than Java 6.
